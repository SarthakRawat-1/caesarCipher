## Features

- **Encrypt Text:** Shifts each letter by a specified number of positions to create encrypted text.
- **Decrypt Text:** Reverses the process by shifting letters back to their original positions.
- **Customizable Shift:** Allows you to set any integer value as the shift key.
- **Case Preservation:** Maintains the original case (upper or lower) of each letter.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Leaves numbers, symbols, and whitespace unchanged.
